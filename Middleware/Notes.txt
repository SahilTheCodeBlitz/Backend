In Express.js, middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can execute code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

Middleware functions are commonly used for:

1. **Request processing**: Middleware can parse request data, such as extracting form data, JSON payloads, or URL parameters, and make it available to subsequent handlers.

2. **Authentication and authorization**: Middleware can check whether a user is authenticated or has the necessary permissions to access certain routes or resources.

3. **Logging**: Middleware can log information about incoming requests, including details like request method, URL, and timestamp.

4. **Error handling**: Middleware can catch errors that occur during request processing and handle them appropriately, such as sending an error response to the client or logging the error for debugging purposes.

5. **Response modification**: Middleware can modify the response object before it is sent back to the client, for example, by adding headers or manipulating the response body.

6. **Routing**: Middleware can perform routing based on various criteria, such as the request path or HTTP method, and either handle the request or pass it on to the next middleware in the stack.

Middleware functions are added to the Express application using the `app.use()` method or by specifying them directly when defining routes. They are executed sequentially in the order they are added to the application, and each middleware function can choose to either handle the request and response or pass control to the next middleware using the `next()` function.

Overall, middleware functions in Express provide a flexible and powerful mechanism for implementing common web application features and handling cross-cutting concerns in a modular and reusable way.
